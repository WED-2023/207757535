    1. The three deffrences are:
        <li class="first_a answers">Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web", Web 2.0 is the "participative social Web" and Web 3.0 is the "read, write, execute Web".</li>
        <li class="first_a answers">Web 1.0 is Visual/interactive Web, Web 2.0 is Programmable Web and Web 3.0 is Linked data Web.</li>
        <li class="first_a answers">Web 1.0 is Home pages, Web 2.0 is Wikis and blogs and Web 3.0 is Waves and live streams.</li>
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p class="answers">
   2. Examples for each difference:
   <li class="sec_a answers">1. Web 1.0, or the "read-only Web," represents the early days of the internet when websites primarily consisted of static pages containing information. 
       Users could access these pages to read the content but had limited interaction or ability to contribute, While Web 2.0 , or the "participative social Web," reflects the evolution of the internet into a more interactive and collaborative platform. 
       Websites began incorporating features such as social media, user-generated content, and online communities, enabling users to create, share, and interact with content.
       Web 3.0, or the "read, write, execute Web," represents the next phase of the internet, characterized by intelligent applications, decentralized platforms, and immersive experiences. It empowers users not only to consume and contribute content but
       also to execute complex tasks, leverage machine learning algorithms, and interact with a more intelligent and interconnected digital environment.</li>
    <li class="sec_a answers">2. A typical use case for Web 1.0 would be a static business website. These websites often contained information about the company, its products or services, contact details, and perhaps some images or simple animations. Users could navigate through 
       the website's pages to find information but had limited interaction beyond clicking links, A prime example of this stage is a social networking application like Facebook or LinkedIn. These platforms allow users not only to consume content but also 
       to create, share, and interact with it in various ways. Users can post updates, share photos and videos, connect with friends or colleagues, join groups, and participate in discussions,  A use case for Web 3.0 could be a semantic search engine or recommendation system. 
       These applications utilize linked data standards such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and ontologies to understand the relationships between different pieces of information on the web.</li>
    <li class="sec_a answers">3. In the early days of the internet, websites were primarily static and consisted of simple home pages. A typical use case for Web 1.0 would be a personal website or blog. These websites served as digital equivalents of personal journals or 
        diaries, where individuals could share their thoughts, experiences, and interests with a global audience. Users could visit these websites to read the content, view photos, and perhaps leave comments or guestbook entries. However, there was limited interactivity beyond basic navigation.
       While Web 2.0 ushered in the era of user-generated content and collaboration. A prime example of this stage is a wiki platform like Wikipedia or a blogging platform like WordPress. These platforms enable users not only to consume content but also to contribute and collaborate on its creation. 
       Users can create and edit articles, share knowledge and insights, participate in discussions, and build communities around shared interests, And Web 3.0 emphasizes real-time interaction and communication, facilitated by technologies such as live streaming and collaborative editing. A use case for Web 3.0 
       could be a real-time communication platform like Slack or Discord, which enables teams to collaborate and communicate in real-time through text, voice, and video channels.</li>
